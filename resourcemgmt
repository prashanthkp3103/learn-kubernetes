When you specify a Pod, you can optionally specify how much of each resource a container needs. The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory (RAM); there are others.
When you specify the resource request for containers in a Pod, the kube-scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on.
When you specify a resource limit for a container, the kubelet enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set.
The kubelet also reserves at least the request amount of that system resource specifically for that container to use.


For each container, you can specify resource limits and requests, including the following:
spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu
spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory
spec.containers[].resources.limits.hugepages-<size>

spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu
spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory
spec.containers[].resources.requests.hugepages-<size>

what is request and limit?
if the resource is there it will allocate otherwise wont
request : i want this resource must and should schedule for the pod ( this is mandatory)
limit: if available it will allocate (like a salary bonus)
