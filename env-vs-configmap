env	  : all the properties are given to pod as env in hardcored value
Configmap : can be used in realtime
            store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables
            direct key value pair to pod
            referencing from config properties whatever needed
            referring to entire config followed file configmap name
            defining as volume to pod and referring it as mount path
secret: this should come centralized place, cant be used in realtime
        contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key
        base64 format
        we can define as key value to pod
        or
        we can mount the secret file to pod
        this is no use as anyone can convert and see the secret
